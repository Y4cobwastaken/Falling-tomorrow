# 🌒 Nothing Beside Remains

*“Time doesn’t matter. The end is inevitable. So what will you do with what you have?”*

**Nothing Beside Remains** is a narrative-driven adventure game set in a magical world on the edge of collapse.  
You play as a nameless 17-year-old boy transported from Earth into a decaying realm once ruled by a now-extinct robot civilization.  
The skies fracture. Time slips. Four ancient artifacts hold the key to understanding how to live—even when the end is already written.

## 🧠 Concept & Inspiration

This is a personal project inspired by:

- **My own experiences and questions about time and meaning**
- The emotional depth and visual storytelling of **Makoto Shinkai**’s films  
  *(Your Name, Weathering with You, The Garden of Words)*
- Games like:
  - *Outer Wilds*
  - *Journey*
  - *NieR: Automata*

## 💬 Final Thought

**Nothing Beside Remains** is more than a game—  
It’s a reflection on time, inevitability, and meaning.  
The world is fading. The future is falling.  
But there is still time.  
**What will you do with it?**
