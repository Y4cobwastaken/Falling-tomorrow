# 🗺 World Map & Regions

This folder contains all map-related planning for **Nothing Beside Remains** — a world nearly **three times the size of Earth**, designed for open exploration, narrative discovery, and physics-driven traversal.

---

## 📏 Scale & Layout

- **Paper Size:** A3
- **Scale:** 1 cm = 0.25 km (250 meters)
- This scale allows for real-world terrain accuracy when translated into the engine
- Total world coverage: Thousands of kilometers, layered by zones, regions, and key locations

> The world map is not just a background — it’s a **narrative device**. Each region is placed deliberately to reflect history, emotion, artifact influence, and world decay.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `base-map/` – Scans and digital versions of the original hand-drawn A3 map
- `regions/` – Descriptions and metadata for over **500 named regions**, including terrain, history, and gameplay relevance
- `cities/` – Ruins, settlements, and lost civilizations — often tied to artifact zones or bosses
- `travel/` – Notes on traversal systems, movement difficulty, mount routes, and fast travel mechanics
- `terrain-layers/` – Raw terrain types, elevation, biome markers, and spatial effects
- `zones/` – Grid and coordinate-based simulation data for physics and narrative integration

---

## 🌍 Design Principles

The map is designed with the following principles:

- **Relativity-aware movement:** Distance isn't always linear; artifacts, zone edges, and physics can warp movement paths
- **Exploration-first philosophy:** Players are rewarded for curiosity, not checklist clearing
- **Layered realism:** Environmental clues reflect lore, past civilizations, and natural decay
- **Dynamic scale:** Travel can feel vast or compressed depending on artifact presence and simulation rules

---

## 🧭 Key Concepts

- The map is **not static**. Certain zones shift, compress, or warp based on player actions and artifact logic.
- Some paths become visible only under specific time or environmental conditions.
- The map reflects the consequences of a long-dead automaton civilization — with scars, patterns, and overgrowth visible from macro to micro scales.

## 🔗 Related Folders

- `planning/` – Ties each region to its narrative and emotional tone
- `artifacts/` – Zones of influence that shift space, time, and perception
- `systems/physics/` – Uses coordinate data from `zones/` to simulate flow and field effects
- `game/` – Runtime generation of travel and region logic from this map base

## ⚠️ Spoiler Warning

Some regional names, locations, and descriptions contain **late-game narrative clues**, especially involving bosses and artifacts. Read with caution if you're avoiding story spoilers.
