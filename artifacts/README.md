# 🗿 Artifacts

This folder contains all design notes, powers, mechanics, and narrative context for the **four ancient artifacts** in *Nothing Beside Remains*.

The artifacts are not just gameplay tools — they are keys to understanding the world’s broken laws and uncovering the truth behind the automaton collapse.

## 🧠 Artifact Concept

Each artifact represents a **fundamental concept** that shapes the world's physics, time, and perception. Together, they were once used by the automatons to stabilize their reality.

They were **scattered** during a failed uprising that attempted to control the world's relativistic structure. This shattering event collapsed the energy field that sustained the automaton civilization.

You, the boy, must **recover and correctly align** the artifacts to restore balance — or accelerate the collapse.

## 🧭 The Four Artifacts

| Symbol | Name                  | Concept         | Zone Location     | Boss Order     |
|--------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| `£`    | Time Artifact          | Time & Memory    | Inner Zone (Top Left) | Act 1 (after boss) |
| `*`    | Space Artifact         | Distance & Mass  | Inner Zone (Top Right) | Act 2 (before boss) |
| `#`    | Energy Artifact        | Flow & Motion    | Inner Zone (Bottom Right) | Act 3 (before boss) |
| `~`    | Consciousness Artifact | Thought & Perception | Inner Zone (Bottom Left) | Act 4 (inside automaton) |

Final alignment forms an **X-shape** across the inner zone. Once restored, they grant access to the final confrontation in Act 5.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `£-time/` – Planning for the Time Artifact (e.g., localized memory bubbles, time distortions)
- `*-space/` – Notes on the Space Artifact (e.g., folding terrain, unreachable distances)
- `#-energy/` – Details for the Energy Artifact (e.g., motion loops, kinetic puzzles)
- `~-consciousness/` – The most abstract artifact, allowing Math Force perception and world awareness
- `alignment/` – Lore and logic behind artifact positioning, convergence, and failure states
- `mechanics/` – How each artifact modifies physics, interaction, and UI when equipped or near

---

## 🌌 Integration with Game Systems

Artifacts interact with:

- `physics/` – Core logic layer; artifacts modify simulation values
- `map/` – Region effects, distortion fields, hidden paths
- `planning/acts/` – Each act’s climax centers around the discovery or consequence of an artifact
- `finale/` – Act 5’s arena fuses all artifacts into a final reality-shifting event

---

## 🧩 Gameplay Design

- Players can **activate**, **rotate**, or **resist** artifact effects depending on their understanding and proximity.
- Artifact powers are **not explained outright** — they must be felt, tested, and decoded through exploration.
- Some puzzle elements can only be solved by holding the correct artifact or interpreting its **symbolic behavior**.
