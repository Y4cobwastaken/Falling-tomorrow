# Implementation Notes — Maths Section

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details, design choices, and important notes regarding the Maths section of the project. It is intended to assist developers in understanding the architecture and key algorithms used.

---

## Structure

- The maths section is organized into modular components based on mathematical topics (e.g., algebra, calculus, geometry).
- Each module exposes core functions and utilities relevant to its domain.
- Common utilities (e.g., matrix operations, numerical methods) are located in `/utils` for reuse across modules.

---

## Key Algorithms and Methods

- **Numerical Methods:** Implementation of root-finding (Newton-Raphson), integration (Simpson’s rule), and differentiation.
- **Linear Algebra:** Matrix multiplication, inversion, eigenvalue computation, vector operations.
- **Symbolic Computation:** Basic parsing of mathematical expressions for symbolic manipulation.
- **Graph Theory:** Algorithms such as Dijkstra’s shortest path and BFS for graph traversal.

---

## Dependencies

- Uses [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for efficient numerical operations and array manipulations.
- Relies on [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) for symbolic mathematics and equation solving.
- Custom implementations are provided when dependency functionality is insufficient or for educational purposes.

---

## Performance Considerations

- Computationally intensive algorithms are optimized with vectorized operations where possible.
- Caching is implemented for repeated calculations to improve responsiveness.
- Lazy evaluation is used in symbolic computations to defer processing until necessary.

---

## Testing

- Unit tests cover core functions in each module, focusing on correctness and edge cases.
- Numerical stability is tested by comparing outputs with known analytical solutions.
- Performance benchmarks identify bottlenecks and guide optimizations.

---

## Future Improvements

- Extend symbolic math capabilities to support more complex expressions and simplifications.
- Introduce GPU acceleration for heavy matrix computations using libraries such as CuPy.
- Improve error handling for invalid inputs with descriptive exception messages.

---

## Notes for Contributors

- Follow consistent naming conventions and document all new functions with clear docstrings.
- Add unit tests for any new functionality and update existing tests if necessary.
- Ensure any added dependencies are justified and do not bloat the project unnecessarily.
