# Core Principles of the Math System

This file outlines the foundational concepts behind the custom mathematical system in *Nothing Beside Remains*. These principles shape how objects move, how the world responds, and how space behaves in a dying, perception-tied universe.

## 1. **Relativity of Position**

Nothing exists in absolute space. All positions are expressed **relative to meaningful anchors**:
- A landmark, memory, or event
- The player’s current mental/emotional state (optional influence layer)
- A gravitational, magnetic, or conceptual center

Two players in the same "location" may occupy *different coordinates* based on what they’re focused on or connected to.

## 2. **Locally-Coherent Reference Frames**

Every zone (room, biome, sector) defines its own **local frame of reference**:
- Directions (e.g. "up" or "north") may reorient subtly across boundaries
- Velocity may accumulate differently depending on the local field curvature
- Interactions are only valid if they occur within the same local space or between synchronized frames

---

## 3. **Contextual Motion**

Movement is not uniform. Acceleration, inertia, and even **distance traveled** depend on:
- How recently you've interacted with an object or area
- Whether the path aligns with your last known intention
- The rate of world decay (certain areas distort or stretch time/space)

---

## 4. **Perceptual Geometry**

What you *see* affects what is *true*:
- Approaching something with focus will pull it closer (in terms of collision math and proximity triggers)
- Objects behind you or outside your mental scope may lose spatial coherence, flicker out of reach, or become infinitely distant
- World warping is built into coordinate updates, not shaders

---

## 5. **Non-Euclidean Continuity**

The world map does not obey Euclidean geometry. This is handled mathematically, not as an illusion:
- Looping paths that never converge
- Spaces that "grow" when turned around in
- Rooms with entrances that are farther apart than their interiors allow

---

## 6. **Narrative-Driven Constants**

Some constants in the system (like "maximum jump distance", or "safe fall velocity") **change based on narrative state**:
- When carrying an artifact, the world may weigh less
- After a major death, inertia might become sluggish
- Some mechanics only activate when they are *needed*, and the math adapts in real-time

---

This math system isn’t just numbers — it’s a logic framework for a world built on *meaning, memory, and motion*. Each principle is tuned to reinforce the player’s experience and the game's emotional truth.
