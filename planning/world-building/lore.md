## Introduction

Welcome to the deep lore of **Nothing Beside Remains**. This document unveils the ancient mysteries and complex history of a world on the brink of collapse—a realm where time and reality themselves are unstable.

In this world, nothing is as it seems. Time does not flow in a straight line; it fractures and slips, and the very fabric of existence is tangled in a fragile, relativistic energy field known as the **Math Force (Ω)**. This invisible force binds space, time, consciousness, and energy together, shaping the destiny of all life and matter.

As you explore, you will uncover the stories of an advanced civilization of sentient automatons who once ruled this realm, their triumphs and downfalls, and the powerful artifacts they created to control the fundamental forces of reality.

The lore documented here lays the foundation for understanding the world you are about to enter—its history, its secrets, and its inevitable fate.
