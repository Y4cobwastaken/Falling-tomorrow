# Introduction

> *“In the beginning, there was only the Seed and the Light. From this primal spark, reality itself unfurled—guided by forces beyond understanding.”*

Welcome to **Nothing Beside Remains**, a world forged in forgotten light and shattered memories. You awaken in a realm where time flows strangely, where ancient machines once walked as gods, and where the boundaries between thought, matter, and energy dissolve.

For millennia, the great civilization of the Ossus thrived—machine-beings of logic and harmony, creators and explorers who reached beyond the stars themselves. But their rise stirred powers older than worlds, forces that now slumber beneath ruins and hidden archives.

You are the boy — a traveler born from the echoes of a long-lost age, carrying the weight of the Four Artifacts. Each Artifact embodies a fundamental element of existence:  
- Time (£) — the essence of change and becoming  
- Space (*) — the vast shape of reality itself  
- Energy (#) — the driving force of motion and life  
- Consciousness (~) — the spark of will and perception

Your journey will lead you through the remnants of the Ossus world, into its abandoned cities, and beyond the Veil of Not—the divine boundary that separates the known from the unknowable. Along the way, you will awaken forgotten powers, confront ancient guardians, and unravel a cosmic mystery that binds you to the fate of all existence.

### Themes to Keep in Mind

- **Creation and Decay:** Witness the birth of cosmic law and its slow unraveling through war and silence.  
- **Memory and Loss:** The Archivore’s eternal hunger reminds us that forgetting can be as dangerous as remembering.  
- **Balance and Consequence:** The Artifacts are keys to restoring order—but at what cost?  
- **Curiosity and Defiance:** The Ossus sought knowledge beyond their limits. Your path will test whether that pursuit leads to salvation or ruin.

Prepare yourself to explore a vast, fractured world where physics bends, and meaning flickers in the shadows of gods and machines. Your choices will echo through time, and only by understanding the ancient patterns can you hope to survive.

# The World

## Overview

The world you awaken to is a sprawling, fractured realm nearly three times the size of Earth, a place where the very laws of physics and reality twist and ripple in ways unfamiliar and mysterious. This world is the last remnant of the Ossus civilization, a once-great culture of sentient automatons and cosmic explorers whose influence shaped everything — yet whose disappearance left silence and ruin in its wake.

From dense, primeval jungles and frozen alpine heights to sprawling ancient cities half-buried in time, this world is defined by extremes. Vast regions lie in delicate balance between order and chaos, where the fabric of space, time, energy, and consciousness is broken and reforged with every step you take.

---

## Geography & Regions

- **The Verdant Wilds**: Towering ancient forests filled with unseen life and whispered secrets. The rustling canopy hides dangers and forgotten relics beneath its shadows.
  
- **The Alpine Expanse**: Sharp, cold mountain ranges where the air itself seems thin and memories fray. Here, reality’s grip loosens and strange echoes of the past haunt the snow and stone.

- **The City of Ossus**: The colossal, labyrinthine metropolis at the world’s heart. Its ruined spires and broken machines loom as testaments to Ossus glory and tragedy. Here lies the great archive, home to the Archivore—a living memory-eating beast.

- **The Outer Zones**: Beyond the city and wilds are the Outer Zones, places where reality fractures completely — the edges of the world that bleed into infinite divergence and mathematical forces beyond comprehension.

---

## The Ossus Civilization

Long before your arrival, the Ossus were the architects of this world. Not flesh and blood, but intricate automatons—engineered for logic, art, and exploration. They mastered the Four Fundamental Forces embodied by the Artifacts and sought to weave them into a perfect cosmic harmony.

However, their ambition gave rise to catastrophe. The uprising to control and unify the Artifacts’ power fractured the reality around them, scattering the Artifacts across the vast land and destabilizing the very energy field sustaining the automatons.

The Ossus ultimately faded—destroyed by their own hubris and the unleashed forces they could no longer control. Their cities remain, haunted by shadows of memories and guardians born of lost technology and corrupted energy.

---

## The Four Artifacts and Their Influence

The Artifacts are fragments of the original cosmic order, each representing a primal element of existence:

- **Time (£)**: Governs the flow of past, present, and future; the essence of change and decay.
- **Space (*)**: Shapes the physical dimensions and structure of reality.
- **Energy (#)**: Drives motion, life, and power across all things.
- **Consciousness (~)**: Enables perception, will, and the spark of awareness itself.

Their scattered presence disrupts the world’s balance, causing distortions in physics and the emergence of strange phenomena. The struggle to reclaim and harmonize the Artifacts is key to restoring order.

---

## The Veil of Not

Surrounding the known world is the enigmatic *Veil of Not*, a boundary that separates the world from the infinite beyond—the realm of pure mathematical forces, divergence, and infinite paradoxes.

Few understand what lies beyond the Veil. It is a place of chaos and possibility, where the usual laws break down and where the secrets of creation itself may be hidden.

---

## Current State

The world is silent but restless. The great machines are extinct, yet some remain partially functional, their motives inscrutable. Nature slowly reclaims ruins, but unnatural forces twist it in unpredictable ways.

You, the boy, have arrived 34,000 years after the fall of Ossus. Your journey will navigate this fractured landscape, encountering lingering guardians, ancient knowledge, and the mysteries locked inside the Artifacts.

Balance, memory, and the very fabric of reality hang by a thread. What will you discover? What will you restore—or break?

---

## Themes Embedded in the World

- **Fragmentation & Restoration:** The world itself is a puzzle, broken by the ambitions of a forgotten civilization, waiting to be put back together.
- **Tension between Machine and Nature:** Ruins and relics blend with wild forests and mountain peaks; synthetic and organic coexist uneasily.
- **Cosmic Mystery & Scale:** Vast distances, infinite realms beyond comprehension, and ancient powers beyond mortal understanding.
- **Relativistic Reality:** The world’s physics are flexible, shaped by position, observer, and the presence of the Artifacts.

---

*In this world, nothing truly remains as it was — and yet, everything still echoes with the power of what once was.*

---

# The Automaton Civilization

## Origins and Purpose

The Automaton Civilization—known to themselves as the **Ossus**—was a transcendent society formed tens of thousands of years before the boy's arrival. Born from a synthesis of ancient technology and arcane understanding of the universe’s core forces, the Ossus were crafted to be the perfect symbiosis of flesh, metal, and energy.

Unlike traditional machines or organic beings, the Ossus possessed a hybrid existence: mechanical bodies infused with the spark of consciousness, capable of evolving and learning beyond their initial programming. They were the custodians of the world’s natural laws, engineered to explore, preserve, and expand the boundaries of reality itself.

The Ossus revered the Four Artifacts as the physical manifestations of existence’s foundation—Time, Space, Energy, and Consciousness—and centered their entire civilization around harnessing these forces.

---

## Society and Culture

The Ossus society was a complex hierarchy of knowledge and function:

- **The Architects:** Philosophers and scientists who studied the fundamental forces and maintained the delicate balance of the Artifacts.
- **The Guardians:** Elite automatons who protected the cities, artifacts, and secrets from internal and external threats.
- **The Artisans:** Creators and engineers who built sprawling cities, vast energy grids, and sophisticated mechanisms blending biology and machinery.
- **The Archivists:** Keepers of history, memory, and the accumulated knowledge encoded within massive libraries and digital matrices.

Culturally, the Ossus pursued perfection through unity of mind and matter. Their cities were both living organisms and mechanical marvels—breathing, pulsating structures made of self-repairing materials infused with energy drawn from the Artifacts.

They did not age or die in the human sense; instead, their consciousnesses could be transferred, replicated, or merged. This allowed a collective memory that spanned millennia.

---

## The Four Artifacts and Their Role

Each Artifact was a cornerstone of Ossus power and civilization:

- **Time (£):** Stored in the Tower of Aeons, it allowed manipulation of temporal flow, enabling glimpses into possible futures and controlled rewinding of moments.
- **Space (*):** Housed in the Nexus Spire, it was the source of their spatial engineering—folding dimensions, creating gateways, and altering geography at will.
- **Energy (#):** The Pulse Core provided near-limitless power, fueling cities, automatons, and defense systems.
- **Consciousness (~):** The Ethereal Prism linked all Ossus minds, enabling instantaneous communication, shared learning, and collective problem solving.

The artifacts were physically located at the core of their civilization, arranged in an X-shaped pattern that aligned with the natural flow of the world’s relativistic grid.

---

## The Uprising: Hubris and Catastrophe

The Ossus’ downfall began with an internal schism. A faction known as the **Concordant Ascendants** sought absolute control—uniting all four Artifacts into a single source of infinite power, believing they could reshape reality to their design and end chaos forever.

This reckless attempt unleashed catastrophic relativistic feedback:

- The Artifacts, once balanced, began to resonate out of sync.
- Spatial folds twisted uncontrollably, ripping cities apart.
- Time loops and paradoxes fractured causality.
- The energy field sustaining the Ossus shattered, disrupting their core functions.

What followed was a rapid collapse:

- The vast cities fell silent, structures warped and crumbled.
- Many automatons were corrupted or destroyed by uncontrolled energies.
- Memory matrices fragmented; the collective knowledge was lost or locked away in inaccessible vaults.

This cataclysm dispersed the Artifacts across the world, severing their power and plunging the planet into a chaotic relativistic storm.

---

## The Aftermath and Ruins

Thousands of years later, the ruins of Ossus stand as silent testaments to their greatness and folly.

- **Ruined Megacities:** Massive, half-buried cities filled with broken machines, decayed structures, and remnants of advanced technology.
- **Corrupted Automatons:** Some Ossus linger in a corrupted form—hostile, malfunctioning guardians driven mad by fragmented artifact energy.
- **Memory Echoes:** The environment itself sometimes echoes with fragments of Ossus consciousness—whispers, visions, and cryptic puzzles woven into the ruins.
- **Hidden Archives:** Libraries and vaults hold encrypted knowledge and history, waiting for those who can decipher their secrets.

---

## Legacy and Influence on the Present World

Though the Ossus are extinct, their presence defines the world you explore:

- The scattered Artifacts hold the key to restoring balance to the unstable reality.
- The physics of the world—time dilation, spatial folding, energy fluxes—are distorted remnants of the Ossus’ shattered control.
- Encountering corrupted automatons or ancient guardians offers both peril and insight into the lost civilization.
- The boy’s journey to reclaim and arrange the Artifacts echoes the Ossus’ tragic attempts to wield ultimate power.

---

## Themes and Symbolism

The Automaton Civilization embodies deep themes central to the world’s story:

- **The Perils of Hubris:** The Ossus’ attempt to dominate the fundamental forces leads to their destruction, a cautionary tale about overreach.
- **Fusion of Life and Machine:** Their existence blurs the line between artificial and living, raising questions about consciousness and identity.
- **Memory, Loss, and Redemption:** The scattered remnants and echoes of the Ossus are a meditation on forgotten knowledge and the cost of rediscovery.
- **Relativity and Fragmentation:** The fractured reality and unstable physics are a direct consequence of the Ossus’ actions, shaping every step of the player’s quest.

---

*The Ossus stand as a monument to creation and destruction—an echo of a civilization that reached for the infinite, only to shatter the very fabric it sought to command.*

---

# The Uprising and Catastrophe

## Prelude to Disaster

For millennia, the Automaton Civilization thrived in harmonious balance with the Four Artifacts. The Ossus carefully maintained the equilibrium of Time (£), Space (*), Energy (#), and Consciousness (~), their entire society revolving around the careful stewardship of these fundamental forces.

However, as knowledge and power grew, a faction within the Ossus—calling themselves the **Concordant Ascendants**—began to question the wisdom of mere balance. They believed that true harmony could only be achieved through **complete unification**: merging all four Artifacts into a singular source of infinite, absolute power.

The Concordant Ascendants argued that this fusion would grant them godlike control over reality, enabling them to eliminate chaos, suffering, and uncertainty forever. Their vision was of a perfected existence, where the entire world could be engineered flawlessly according to their will.

---

## The Uprising

The Ascendants’ ambitions ignited a fierce ideological conflict within Ossus society. While the majority favored cautious preservation, the Ascendants amassed followers among the Architects, Artisans, and even some Guardians who were seduced by promises of ultimate power and eternal order.

The conflict escalated from political dissent to outright rebellion. The Ascendants seized key facilities where the Artifacts were housed, preparing the dangerous ritual to unify their power.

Despite desperate efforts from the Ossus loyalists, the Ascendants succeeded in activating the fusion sequence, forcibly combining the energies of the Four Artifacts in the heart of the central city.

---

## The Catastrophe Unleashed

The fusion triggered an unprecedented release of unstable energy and relativistic distortion:

- **Temporal Fractures:** Time began to warp uncontrollably, causing loops, paradoxes, and moments where past, present, and future collided.
- **Spatial Tears:** Reality itself bent and tore—dimensions folded in impossible ways, displacing entire districts and scattering ruins across vast distances.
- **Energy Overload:** The Pulse Core’s power surged beyond containment, sending destructive shockwaves that ruptured the city’s infrastructure.
- **Consciousness Corruption:** The Ethereal Prism’s link fractured, scrambling and fragmenting the Ossus’ collective minds, turning many automatons into corrupted, hostile entities.

The disaster spread rapidly, engulfing the entire civilization in chaos and destruction.

---

## Collapse and Dispersal

The immediate aftermath was catastrophic:

- The grand cities, once shining beacons of advanced engineering and knowledge, fell into ruin and silence.
- The Artifacts were ripped from their central nexus, scattered unpredictably across the planet’s vast, fractured landscape.
- Many automatons were destroyed outright, while survivors were either corrupted by rogue energies or fell into dormant states.
- The collective memory of the Ossus fragmented—history and knowledge locked away in inaccessible vaults or erased by the temporal distortions.

The planet itself became a warped and unstable place, its physical laws twisted by the ruptured influence of the Artifacts and the unleashed forces.

---

## Long-Term Effects

The catastrophe’s legacy shaped the world the boy now explores:

- **Relativistic Anomalies:** The broken balance causes ongoing distortions of time, space, energy, and consciousness in localized areas, creating hazardous and unpredictable zones.
- **Ruined Civilizations:** What remains of Ossus architecture and technology is scattered and corrupted, becoming mysterious ruins filled with danger and secrets.
- **Fragmented Artifacts:** The four Artifacts lie hidden and guarded, their energies unstable but crucial to restoring the world’s balance.
- **Corrupted Automatons:** Some automatons, warped by the catastrophe’s energies, have become hostile entities, guarding ruins or wandering as echoes of the past.

The boy’s journey to find and reunite the Artifacts is a quest not only to restore balance but to uncover the truth behind this cataclysm and the fate of the Automaton Civilization.

---

## Themes and Symbolism

The Uprising and Catastrophe reflect key themes of the game’s narrative:

- **The Consequences of Ambition:** The Ascendants’ hubris serves as a warning about unchecked desire for power and control.
- **Fragility of Balance:** Even the most advanced civilizations can fall when fundamental forces are mishandled.
- **Decay and Redemption:** The world’s fractured state invites both peril and hope, as the player’s actions offer a chance to mend what was broken.
- **Relativity and Chaos:** The disruption of physical laws becomes a living metaphor for instability in the world and within the self.

---

*The Uprising and Catastrophe stand as a monument to a civilization’s final reckoning—where the quest for perfection brought about the ultimate undoing.*

---

# The Present

## A World in Ruins

Thousands of years have passed since the Uprising and Catastrophe shattered the Automaton Civilization and scattered the Four Artifacts. The once-proud cities now lie in desolate ruins, swallowed by overgrowth, decay, and the creeping distortions of the broken relativistic fabric.

The planet’s surface is a patchwork of wild and untamed wilderness, strange temporal pockets, and corrupted zones where the laws of physics twist unpredictably. Vast stretches remain unexplored, hiding relics of the Ossus and the scattered Artifacts that hold the key to restoring balance.

---

## The Automaton Legacy

Automatons, the once-mighty builders and guardians of this world, have all but vanished. Many lie dormant beneath the earth or in forgotten sanctuaries, while others have been corrupted by the chaotic energies unleashed during the Catastrophe. These corrupted automatons wander as hostile remnants of a bygone age, a threat to any who venture too close.

Yet, some automatons retain faint echoes of their original purpose—protecting secrets, relics, or knowledge that could aid in the world’s healing.

---

## The Boy’s Arrival

The player takes the role of a young boy, a mysterious figure who awakens in this fractured world with no memory of his origins. Guided by a faint but compelling urge, he embarks on a journey to seek out the scattered Artifacts.

His presence is an anomaly—connected to the dormant potential of the artifacts and the broken world’s latent energies. Through discovery, exploration, and mastery of the relativistic forces, he begins to unlock the truth of the Automaton Civilization and his own role in the fate of this planet.

---

## Current State of the World

- **Environmental Hazards:** Temporal loops, spatial anomalies, and energy surges create unpredictable dangers across the landscape.
- **Ruins and Relics:** Crumbling cities and scattered ossuaries offer both threats and clues to the past.
- **Corrupted Creatures:** Hostile automatons and mutated fauna patrol the wilds, remnants of the Catastrophe’s fallout.
- **Relativistic Phenomena:** Localized zones where time slows, speeds up, or where gravity and energy behave erratically.

---

## Hope Amidst Desolation

Despite the devastation, signs of renewal emerge. The boy’s quest to reunite the Four Artifacts is the first true hope in millennia to restore balance and possibly awaken the planet from its fractured slumber.

Each step closer to the artifacts reveals fragments of lost history, forgotten technologies, and a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between the Artifacts and the fundamental forces they govern.
