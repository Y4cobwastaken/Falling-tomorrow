# Act 1 – Exploration

## 🎯 Purpose

Introduce the world as a place of wonder, decay, and stillness.  
Build player curiosity through environmental storytelling and visual mystery.  
Encourage wandering — minimal guidance, focused on atmosphere and observation.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Structure

- One-way navigation with some branching paths  
- Light platforming, spatial puzzles, visual storytelling  
- No direct guidance or objectives, player learns through environment  

---

## 🌍 Environment Zones

### 📍 Zone 1 – The Forest Ruins

- Dense alien trees with violet leaves  
- Broken overpasses made of faded black stone and twisted metal  
- Strange machines overgrown with glowing moss  
- Interactive switches respond to proximity  

---

### 📍 Zone 2 – The Tower Valley

- Vast bowl-shaped valley with metal vines and sunken towers  
- Echoes of movement — sometimes footsteps sound behind but no one’s there  
- Tower fragments hover mid-air, frozen in place by failed time spells  

---

### 📍 Zone 3 – The Echoing Garden

- Stillest zone. No creatures, no music.  
- Player occasionally sees "memories" — ghostlike silhouettes performing mundane tasks  
- Boy reacts silently (head tilts, hesitant steps)  
- Final clue here leads to the artifact’s resting area  

---

## 🧠 Narrative Cues

- Breathing gets heavier near major discoveries  
- Environmental symbols point the way subtly (spirals, fading light paths)  
- The world “responds” when you touch ancient things (camera shakes, ambient tone shift)  

---

## 🔮 Environmental Storytelling

- Statues with missing heads, holding objects that resemble the artifacts  
- A mural half-destroyed by time shows the **serpent god** surrounded by fallen cities  
- Old robot faces fused into stone walls — emotionless, but facing you  

---

## 🎧 Sound Design

- Constant shifting ambient tones  
- When standing still, faint ticking in the distance  
- Music shifts subtly when entering new areas  
- Audio “glitches” in key spots (symbolizing time breaking)  

---

## ⚠️ Emotional Goal

- Inspire awe, but with a growing sense of unease  
- Convey that the player is not the first one here  
- Emphasize **loneliness**, but also **purpose**  
- By the time they reach the artifact, they should **feel like it was meant for them**
