### 📷 SHOT 2 – HIS FEET

- **Visual:** Close-up of heavy boots in deep violet grass.
- **Motion:** Very slow camera tilt upward from feet to torso.
- **Lighting:** Soft blue ambient glow, like moonlight — misty surroundings.

---

### 📷 SHOT 3 – THE ENVIRONMENT

- **Visual:** Over-the-shoulder shot. A quiet forest, alien and forgotten.
- **Details:** Tree trunks cracked, moss clinging to rusted metal towers.
- **Color Palette:** Soft blues, greys, purples.

---

### 📷 SHOT 4 – ROTATION SHOT

- **Camera slowly orbits** him as he stands in silence.
- **His expression:** Confused but not panicked. Curious. Focused.
- **Particles in the air:** Glowing flakes drift slowly around.

---

### 📷 SHOT 5 – THE STRANGE REFLECTION

- **Visual:** Close-up of his hand brushing strange white grass.
- **Camera pans to reveal:** A broken shard of metal half-buried nearby.
- **Reflection:** His face in the metal, but subtly wrong — his eyes flicker unnaturally for a single frame (only visible if watching closely).

---

### 📷 SHOT 6 – LONG SHOT (FORESHADOWING)

- **Visual:** Camera behind him. He stands on a ridge.  
- **In the distance:** Faint silhouette of a crumbling tower, half swallowed by the fog.
- **Subtle lighting effect:** Sun (or moon) eclipsed by drifting debris in the sky.

---

### 📷 SHOT 7 – THE FIRST STEP

- **Camera follows** behind him as he starts walking.
- **Environment shifts:** Grass rustles unnaturally. Trees seem to breathe.
- **Sound design:** Slight hum begins — subtle, magical.
