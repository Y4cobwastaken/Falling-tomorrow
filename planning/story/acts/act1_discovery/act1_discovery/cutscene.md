# Act 1 Cutscene – Arrival

**Title Card:**

ACT 1
Discovery


**[Music begins: Distant, soft tones. A single piano note repeats slowly.]**

**[Black screen.]**

> (A faint wind sound. Then, footsteps—rhythmic and grounded. They stop.)

**[Fade in from black.]**

The boy is standing in the middle of a dirt path lined with tall, unfamiliar trees. Their leaves are violet. The sky is dim, but there is no sun.

He looks around slowly. His breath forms clouds despite the warmth.

A gust of wind passes. The trees rustle—but no animals stir.

> (Camera slowly rotates around the boy. He is still.)

He looks down and sees small, glowing particles drifting up from the grass. He kneels, brushes his fingers through them. They scatter, then fade.

He takes a step forward.

> (The camera begins following him from behind. No UI. Just quiet footsteps.)

As he walks, old structures begin to appear through the mist—pillars, broken walkways, strange etchings. The world feels like a memory someone forgot to finish.

The boy touches one of the stone walls. It pulses faintly with light.

He turns his head as if hearing something. Nothing’s there. Just the wind.

He keeps walking. The camera pans up.

**[Music shifts: subtle hope in the melody.]**

Cut to black.

**[Text on screen:]**

*“You don’t know why you’re here. But something inside you says: find it.”*
