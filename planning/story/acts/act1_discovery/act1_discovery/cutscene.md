## 🎥 Camera Direction

**Scene opens:**  
- Black screen with soft wind. Title fades in and out.

**Cut to shot:**
- Close-up of the boy’s boots standing still in violet grass.  
- Slowly tilt up to his face — eyes scanning.

**Camera movement:**
- Slow 360° pan around him as he turns in place, observing the silent forest.
- Brief over-the-shoulder shot: trees sway, faint glowing particles in the air.

**Cutaway shots:**
- His hand brushing the particles, scattering them.
- His reflection in a broken shard of metal.
- He looks toward a distant ruined structure — the camera lingers as if pulled.

**Follow camera:**
- Begins tracking behind him as he walks, no UI or indicators.
- Tilt up to reveal vast ruins beyond thick mist.
- Pull back slightly to frame his smallness against the world.

## 🧠 Mood & Themes

- Emphasis on mystery, curiosity, isolation.
- Everything is strange yet oddly peaceful — nothing feels threatening yet.
- The world is quiet but breathing.
- The boy’s presence here feels *meant*, though unexplained.
