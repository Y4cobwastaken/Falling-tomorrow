# Act 1 – Artifact Interaction & Puzzle

## 🎯 Purpose

Create a meaningful moment of discovery and connection.  
The player finds the first artifact, unlocking deeper mysteries and starting to question the world around them.

---

## 🧩 Puzzle Concept

- The artifact is a **crystal shard embedded in an ancient altar**, half-buried in glowing moss.
- The altar is surrounded by **runes** etched into the ground, which faintly pulse with light.
- Puzzle requires the player to **trace a path through the runes** by interacting with specific stones in the right order.
- The correct path is hinted at by subtle environmental clues:
  - **Patterns in the moss growth**
  - **Faint light trails after rain or wind effects**
  - **Shadow shapes cast by nearby ruins at certain times of day**

## 🔍 Player Interaction

- Player approaches the altar, triggering a subtle animation: the crystal shard pulses softly.
- A soft hum fills the air, encouraging curiosity.
- Interacting with runes lights them up and plays a low chime.
- If the player chooses the wrong rune, the light fades, and the hum distorts briefly.
- Once the correct sequence is completed:
  - The crystal shard levitates slowly from the altar.
  - A brief vision flashes: the boy sees a glimpse of a future self, running through collapsing ruins, breathless but determined.
