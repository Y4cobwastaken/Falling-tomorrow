**Title Card:**
ACT 2
The Fracture

**Music:** Glitched, bending ambient tones. Echoes and distortion.

---

## 🎬 Cutscene

The boy walks across a desert made of fractured stone.  
He hears his own voice behind him, but no one is there.  
The sky cracks. A version of himself flickers in and out of view.

## 🧠 New Mechanic: Insanity Meter

- Introduced at the start of Act 2.
- Increases with isolation, darkness, stillness.
- Triggers hallucinations: shadow figures, resets, whispers, mirror flickers.
- At max: sleep paralysis scenes and reality distortion.

---

## 🌍 The Whispering Shell

- A ruin of glass and steel. Nothing living.
- Reflective surfaces lie.
- Quotes appear carved in stone:  
  *“When you become uncertain of yourself, the world will break for you.”*

---

## 🕳️ The Cave

- Deep underground, the insanity meter spikes.
- No sound. No music. Just breathing.
- The boy sees another version of himself — trembling.
- The boss awakens.

---

## 👁 Boss: The Mind’s Mouth

- Form: Shadowed limbs and fragmented voice.
- Mimics the player's controls with a delay.
- Uses false arenas and twisted memories.
- Final move: crawls into the boy’s chest.

---

## 🔫 Final Choice

- “End It” appears on screen.
  - If clicked: The boy imagines shooting himself. Wakes up. Artifact appears.
  - If not clicked: The entity fades. A softer vision appears.

---

## ✨ Artifact Vision

- If shot: the boy stands on a rooftop, about to fall.
- If resisted: the boy sees himself in a mirror — breathing, together.

---

## 🎭 Emotional Feel

- Collapse.
- Terror of losing self.
- Hallucination vs truth.
- Fear as a reflection of meaninglessness.
