## 🎬 Cutscene

A quiet breeze. Grass sways in a strange light. The boy stands, confused, alone.  
He walks forward — the trees glow faintly. He follows.

---

## 🌍 World Feel

- Everything is abandoned and beautiful.
- There are no living beings, only environments.
- The player explores ruins with tapestries, statues, machinery.
- Quests are vague — e.g., *“You feel an urge to find something.”*
- The only guidance comes from the world itself.

---

## 🧩 Artifact

- Hidden in a domed observatory, buried beneath vines.
- To access it, the player must:
  - Navigate environmental puzzles (e.g., align fractured light beams).
  - Find keys that resemble broken stars.

---

## 🐍 Boss: The Whispering Serpent [THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER NAME, NOT THE OFFICIAL NAME]

- It is massive, invisible, and constantly moving.
- It **cannot attack**, but you must dodge and track it by sound and environmental clues (shifting grass, dust).
- The goal is to **outmaneuver it** and activate four towers to reveal the artifact.

## ✨ Artifact Vision

When touched, the boy sees:
> Himself laughing in the rain, surrounded by people.  
> Then alone in the same place — older, silent.

---

## 🎭 Emotional Feel

- Wonder.
- Loneliness.
- Naïve curiosity.
- You begin to question: *Why is this world so quiet? What happened here?*
