## 🎥 CUTSCENE: “The Arrival”

A black screen pulses with ambient sound. Suddenly, a flash—  
The boy awakens in a collapsing forest where shards of metal float in the air and time pulses oddly.

---

## 🌍 WORLD SETTING

- The environment is lush, yet corrupted—like nature and machinery had a war and neither won.
- Time glitches occasionally: wind flows in reverse, shadows freeze.
- No living beings are encountered in this act.
- Environmental storytelling dominates: symbols, remnants, decayed structures.
- Quest prompts are vague:  
  *“You feel pulled toward something ancient.”*

---

## 🧠 THEME: CURIOSITY & NAIVETY

- The boy is driven by instinct, not knowledge.
- Player and character are equally unaware.
- Questions arise: “Why am I here? Why does this world feel familiar?”

---

## 🐍 BOSS: The Hollow Serpent

- A long, transparent snake slithers silently through the air.
- It cannot hurt you—only follow.
- The fight is about **revealing it** using light/reflections from the environment.
- When the snake coils around a cracked pillar, light reveals its shape and it disintegrates.

---

## ✨ ARTIFACT 1

- Hidden inside the ruins the snake was guarding.
- Upon touching:  
  > The boy sees himself standing alone at a birthday party, surrounded by friends who are all turned away from him.

---

## TAKEAWAY

- The world is dying—but it was once full of life.
- The boy and player are **not here
