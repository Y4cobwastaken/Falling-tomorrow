# 📖 Planning

This folder contains all narrative development, emotional structure, and world-building for **Nothing Beside Remains**.

This is the beating heart of the project—where the tone, story, themes, and moment-to-moment experiences are shaped before anything is programmed.

## 🧠 Narrative Philosophy

> “The world is already ending. The question is: what do you do before it does?”

This game is designed to **reflect on time, inevitability, memory, and meaning**. The story isn’t about preventing the end—it’s about confronting it with honesty and beauty.

Narrative is not delivered through exposition, but through:
- **Environmental storytelling**
- **Symbolic dialogue**
- **Interactions with forgotten technology and memory**
- **Emotionally-driven exploration**

## 🌍 Integration with Map & Systems

All planning documents align with the physical world map, drawn on A3 paper at a scale of:

- **1 cm = 0.25 km**

This ensures that story events and traversal reflect the size, structure, and distances in the actual game world.
